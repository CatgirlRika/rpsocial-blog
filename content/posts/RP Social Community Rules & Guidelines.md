Below you’ll find the essentials. Read them, live by them, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you ever need support.

---

## 1. Respect Everyone

Treat every member with decency. Discrimination, harassment, bullying, dogpiling, or targeted hate will get you booted, no warnings required. This includes but isn’t limited to racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, body shaming, or anything that makes this space unsafe for others.

## 2. Consent is Non Negotiable

All roleplay, especially NSFW, dark, or mature plots, **must be consensual** on all sides. If you don’t have a clear yes, it’s a no. Don’t pressure, guilt, or manipulate people into scenes they don’t want. If someone withdraws consent or says “no” at any time, respect it immediately.

## 3. Age Restrictions

You must be **18+** to access or participate in any NSFW or adult coded spaces. Lying about your age is a ban on sight offense.

## 4. No Non Consensual Content

Do **not** write, request, or depict sexual content involving minors (including “aged up” or underage characters), bestiality, or real life non consensual acts. Breaking this rule is an instant and permanent ban, no appeals.

## 5. Tag Your Triggers & NSFW

Be proactive about tagging NSFW, potentially triggering, or heavy topics (e.g., violence, abuse, self-harm, noncon, etc.). Use content warnings (CW: or TW:) at the top of your posts when appropriate. If in doubt, tag it.

## 6. No Spam, Flooding, or Malicious Links

Don’t spam posts, flood channels, or share malware, scams, or phishing links. Advertising personal sites, servers, or outside communities is only allowed in designated promo spaces. DO ask staff if you’re unsure.

## 7. Keep Drama Private

Handle OOC drama, disagreements, or feedback privately and with maturity. If you need help, contact staff. Public callouts, vaguebooking, or dragging fights into main chat will get you warned or silenced.

## 8. One Account Per Person

You’re allowed one main account. If you need a side account for characters or organization, check the site’s alt policy and get approval first. Sockpuppeting to evade bans is an instant, permanent ban.

## 9. Respect Content Ownership

Don’t steal, plagiarize, or repost someone else’s characters, art, or writing without permission. Give credit where it’s due. If you’re using icons, templates, or codes, check and follow creator guidelines.

## 10. Listen to Staff

Staff are here to keep the peace and help you. If you’re asked to adjust your behavior or content, do it. If you disagree, appeal privately. Don’t make it a spectacle.
